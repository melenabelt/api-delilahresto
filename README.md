# Delilah Resto - API

This API is about a restaurant which have users, orders and 
products. All permissions depend on whether or not the user is an administrator

## Clone and Use Repository

To download the GitHub repository, go to the repository link, click the "Clone" button, and then type the command "Git clone followed by the Delilah Resto repository link" on your computer.

```bash
git clone
```

In that way, you'll be able to work on the project. If you have Git Bash and you want to open Visual Studio with your entire project, you have to run the "code ." command (while in the folder that contains it).

```bash
code .
```

## Install dependencies

To install the dependencies, you must go to the server folder in Visual Studio Code, open the terminal and execute the command:

```bash
npm install
```

## User password

The main recommendation is that when you log in to phpmyadmin, change the root password, which usually comes up empty. In this project I left it empty, but you can put yours in if you want.

## Create database with its tables

To do this, open the delilahresto.sql file located in the database folder, copy everything inside that file, go to phpmyadmin, paste all of the above as a query and click the "Continue" button.

## lift the server

Go to the server folder, open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Documentación YAML

To create, update and/or delete users, products and orders in Postman, look at the yaml file inside the server folder; there you will find the api documentation along with the verbs to be executed
